**Doc O'clock: A Telemedicine Mobile Application in Kenya**

**Description**
Doc O’Clock is a telemedicine and USSD-based healthcare system that connects patients and doctors through a mobile app and a web-based admin dashboard. The users (patients) can book appointments based on the dates that are convenient to them among the available list, edit and delete them, and make payments for the consultations beforehand. They can hold a virtual consultation via either video or voice call, view the electronic health records (EHRs), receive the e-prescription issues by the doctor after the  consultation and order the medicine through MyDawa to be delivered to their doorstep. As for the doctors, they can view, edit and delete their appointments, hold the virtual consultations, view and edit the patient's EHR accordingly, and issue e-prescriptions once they have come to a disgnosis. As for the admins, there is a web-based dashboard where they can view the usage of both the application and the USSD modules across various periods of time visually, they can export the reports as pdf and also manage the accounts of the users. The USSD module was built to cater for the offline users and caters to both English and Swahili speakers. Its users can book, edit and delete appointments, make payments for the consultations beforehand then receive an SMS notification confirming their booking. The virtual consultations are to be held via voice call and their e-prescriptions and diagnosis are to be issues via text message.
